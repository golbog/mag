**data_vizualization.ipynb** - This notebook shows basic implementation of reading data, changing SMILES strings into fingerprints and applying PCA and then t-SNE or MDS. This data is then visualized in a graph.

**data_classification.ipynb** - This notebook classifies fingerprints with random forest classifier and shows ROC AUC values of classification of a seperate test set.
